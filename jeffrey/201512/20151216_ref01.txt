 configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
 information available from all alfred servers in the network.

knock - 0.5-1 - It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
 looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
 makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
 port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
 knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic
 even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
 detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
 defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
 up holes in a firewall for quick access.
 This package contains the port-knocking client.

owshell - 2.9p5-1 - OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
 devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual
 filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
 properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
 and written.

 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.

 This package contains the OWFS shell utilities.

 to /dev/lp0, 9101 to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to /dev/lp2. The
 default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.

 contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with
 unreachable or down DNS servers (for example in dial-in networking).

 pdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and
 can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often
 minute-long hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries.
peercast - 0.1214-3 - PeerCast is a fresh new P2P streaming server. It can stream music and

 IPs while you use P2P.

 existing nodes to alter their configuration, because its IP address is
 automatically distributed across the whole virtual network.
pen - 0.18.0-1 - This is pen, a load balancer for "simple" tcp based protocols
 such as http or smtp. It allows several servers to appear as
 one to the outside and automatically detects servers that are

 data are stored in SQLite3 databases. At a configurable interval, wview will
 utilize the archive history and current conditions to generate weather images
 (buckets, dials and graphs) and HTML web pages based on user-configurable HTML
 templates.

 After install you need to create a directory holding archive and create the
 database there by running there
 sqlite3 wview-archive.sdb '.read /etc/wview/wview-archive.sql'

 Then copy all your theme files to the appropriate place (on a non-volatile
 storage), and html-templates.conf to /etc/wview/; then wviewconfig to configure
 the system.

 Read and amend /etc/init.d/wview appropriately for your particular setup!
